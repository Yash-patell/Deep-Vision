# ðŸŽ­ Deep Vision a Deepfake Videos Detection Project
This project is a deep learningâ€“based system to detect deepfake videos using a pre-trained Xception model. It offers two interfaces:

- âœ… A Streamlit app for a quick standalone web interface
- âœ… A FastAPI backend with an included web frontend where users can upload a video and see real-time predictions â€” making it suitable for easy deployment on servers or cloud platforms

<br>

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Detect deepfake videos using the Xception neural network
- Streamlit app for video upload and result display
- FastAPI backend with a built-in web frontend for uploading videos and viewing real-time predictions and easy of use
- Real-time frame extraction and analysis
-  Easy-to-use web interface
-  Pretrained models and tokenizers included

<br>

## ðŸš€ How It Works
- User uploads a video through the Streamlit app or the FastAPI frontend.
- The backend extracts frames from the video.
- Frames are preprocessed and passed through the Xception model.
- The model predicts whether the video is real or a deepfake, along with a confidence score.
- The app or API returns and displays the final prediction result.
